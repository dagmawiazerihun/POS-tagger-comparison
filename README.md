# POS Tagger Comparison

## Overview

This project compares different Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging methods and their performance on various datasets. POS tagging is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) pipelines, used to assign parts of speech to each word in a given text, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.

## Introduction

In this project, we implement and compare different POS tagging algorithms to evaluate their accuracy and efficiency. The primary focus is on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each method when applied to different types of text data.

## Features

- **Multiple POS Tagging Algorithms**: Implementation of various POS tagging methods.
- **Performance Comparison**: Detailed comparison of accuracy, speed, and efficiency.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Ability to tweak and customize the parameters of each POS tagger.

## Data

The datasets used for training and testing the POS taggers include:

- Standard NLP datasets (e.g., Penn Treebank)
- Custom datasets (if applicable)

## Methods

The following POS tagging algorithms are implemented and compared:

1. **Rule-Based Tagger**: Uses a set of hand-crafted linguistic rules.
2. **Statistical Tagger**: Utilizes probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Models (HMM).
3. **Machine Learning Tagger**: Employs machine learning algorithms like Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
4. **Deep Learning Tagger**: Leverages neural networks for tagging.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dagmawiazerihun/POS-tagger-comparison.git
    cd POS-tagger-comparison
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
    Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the POS tagger comparison, use the following command:
```sh
python dagmawiprogram3final.py
